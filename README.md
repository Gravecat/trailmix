The Trailmix library is a collection of mismatched, odd bits and pieces of utility code that I've used a lot in my last few projects. It primarily consists of string manipulation, math-related functions, some file-handling utility, and other bits and pieces.

It's primarily intended for use in my own personal projects, but I'm putting it up here so that anyone can use it, or plunder whatever bits might be helpful.
