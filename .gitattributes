# This is all pretty standard stuff, mostly telling GitHub Linguist what file types are, as well as excluding any third-party code from
# counting towards the stats. A lot of this stuff is auto-detected by GitHub Linguist, but it's not perfect. Just gonna specify a bunch
# of them to make absolutely sure it knows what's what.
